Here’s a concise README.md file tailored to your setup. It documents how to recreate the Python 3.10.16 virtual environment on your Fedora system, avoiding the symlink issues we encountered, and ties it to your docker-compose using python:3.10-slim. Feel free to adjust it to fit your project’s specifics!

# NewChunky Project

This project uses Python 3.10.16 in both local development (via `venv`) and Docker (via `python:3.10-slim`). Below are instructions to set up the local environment on Fedora, ensuring compatibility with the Docker setup.

## Prerequisites
- Fedora Linux (tested as of April 2025)
- Python 3.10 installed: `sudo dnf install python3.10`
- Docker and `docker-compose` installed

## Local Development Setup

### Create the Virtual Environment
To match the Docker image (`python:3.10-slim`), use Python 3.10.16 with a `venv`. Use `--copies` to avoid symlink issues after Fedora upgrades:
```bash
rm -rf venv  # Remove old venv if it exists
/usr/bin/python3.10 -m venv --copies venv
source venv/bin/activate
Verify Python Version
After activation, confirm the version:
bash
python --version  # Should output Python 3.10.16
Install Dependencies
Upgrade pip and install project requirements:
bash
pip install --upgrade pip wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Update with your dependencies
Running the App
Start your application (replace app.py with your entry point):
bash
python app.py
Docker Setup
The project uses docker-compose with a service based on python:3.10-slim. See docker-compose.yml for details.
Build and Run
bash
docker-compose up --build
Verify Docker Python Version
Check the Python version in the container:
bash
docker-compose exec <service_name> python --version  # Should output Python 3.10.x
Notes
Fedora’s default Python (e.g., 3.13.2) can interfere with venv symlinks after upgrades. Using --copies ensures the venv stays tied to 3.10.16.
If the venv version mismatches (e.g., shows 3.13.2), recreate it with the steps above.
Keep requirements.txt synced between local and Docker environments for consistency.
Troubleshooting
If python --version is wrong in the venv, check venv/bin/python with ls -l and recreate with --copies.
For Docker issues, inspect the image: docker run -it python:3.10-slim python --version.

### How to Use It
1. Save this as `README.md` in `~/projects/newchunky/`.
2. Replace `<service_name>` in the Docker section with your actual service name from `docker-compose.yml` (e.g., `app` or `web`).
3. If you have a specific `requirements.txt` or entry point (like `main.py`), update those lines accordingly.

This should give you a solid reference to avoid future headaches. Want me to tweak anything—like adding more project-specific details or a section for your app’s purpose?
